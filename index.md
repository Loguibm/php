# PHP
{: #php_runtime}

The PHP runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is powered by the php_buildpack.
The php_buildpack provides a complete runtime environment for PHP
apps.
{: shortdesc}

The php_buildpack is used in the following conditions:
* Your app contains a composer.json file, or
* your app contains a *.php file, or
* your app defines a ${WEBDIR} variable in its [options.json](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/php/gsg-php-config.html) file, and that variable is set to an existing directory within your app.

## Starter application
{: #starter_application}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides a PHP starter app.  The PHP starter application is a simple PHP app that provides a template that you can use for your app. You can experiment with the starter app, and make and push changes to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}
environment.  See [Using the starter applications](/docs/cfapps/starter_app_usage.html) for help with using the starter app.

## Enforce HTTPS on all pages in your application
{: #enforce_https}

To enforce using HTTPS instead of HTTP on all pages in your application when running in Bluemix using Apache, the following changes need to be made to your ".htaccess" file.  This rule will apply to any request which was not made using HTTPS only when running in Bluemix.

```
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !=https [NC]
RewriteCond %{ENV:BLUEMIX_REGION} !^$
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

## Runtime versions
{: #runtime_versions}

You can specify the version of PHP to be used by your app in the composer.json file. For example:

```
{
    "require": {
        "php": "7.0.*"
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}
For more information, see [Composer Package links  ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#package-links).

When a version is not specified, version 5.5.38 is chosen by default.

### Available versions:
{: #available_versions}

The following PHP versions are available in the
[PHP buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.27)
currently installed in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}:
